# EYE Gaming

# Introduction

Creation of a python program using CNN (convolutional Neural Network) and a simple WebCam, that translate eyes gestures to a code that the computer can
understand allowing to play video games using just your eyes.

AMAZING, don't you think?

# Video examples

I'm leaving some short videos playing GTA V using my eyes.

Using eyes up, to start and stop moving. Eyes left and right to move left and right, and eyes closed to get into the car.

Using wink left to hit and then eyes close to get into the car

Winking right to start CAR_MODE, then turning a bit the head or movien eyes (left,right) to control the car

# Problems on the way

* Creation of a Eye language 

* Tuning the key/mouse parameters (sleep, number of pixels, released …) to make the game smooth

* Speed of winks/blinks (Creation of a predictions buffer)

* Light (thousands of pics)

* Computer performance

# Next Steps

* More research on image normalization for NN (for lighting issues)

* Create a better  eye language.

* Detect object in the game, and do actions . Like, if I find enemy, shoot him/her automatically. 

* Interface to customize the links eye movements → Keys 

* Customize sensibilities of eyes movement.
